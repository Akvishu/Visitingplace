<p>Although primarily a Lord Shiva temple, this beautiful temple consists of nine other temples within one and invites people of every faith to bask in its grandeur; using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of Hinduism.Ganga Aarti (ritual of offering prayer to the Ganges river) is held daily at dusk. Several priests perform this ritual by carrying deepam and moving it up and down in a rhythmic tune of bhajans. Special aartis are held on Tuesdays and on religious festivals.The Ganga Aarti starts soon after sunset and lasts for about 45 minutes. In summer the Aarti begins at about 7pm due to late sunsets and in winter it starts at around 6pm. Hundreds of people gather at the ghat every evening to watch the event.<br>
Timings : Morning: 6:30 AM during winters and 5:00 AM during other seasons. Evening: 6:45 PM</p>
